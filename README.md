# 🖥️ CPU Scheduling Simulator   
(FCFS & Non-Preemptive SJF)
   
## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a desktop-based application developed by our group to simulate and visualize CPU scheduling algorithms, focusing on:   

- First Come First Serve (FCFS)   

- Shortest Job First (SJF – Non-preemptive)   

-> The application allows users to load process data from a CSV file, execute scheduling algorithms, and analyze the results through tables, Gantt charts, and performance metrics.
All results can be exported to CSV for verification with textbook formulas and reporting.   

## 📍 Main Feature    

- [x] Import process data from a CSV file
 
- [x] Add, remove, and manage processes in the application

- [x] Execute FCFS (First Come First Serve) scheduling algorithm

- [x] Execute SJF (Non-preemptive) scheduling algorithm

- [x] Display scheduling results in a process table

- [x] Visualize CPU execution using a Gantt Chart

- [x] Calculate:   

- Start Time

- Completion Time
   
- Turnaround Time
  
- Waiting Time

- Average Waiting Time

- Average Turnaround Time

- Export detailed simulation results to a CSV file

- [x] Support stress testing and performance evaluation

##  ⚙️ How to run  

### Step 1 - Launch the application
- [Download CPU Scheduling](https://www.qt.io/development/download)   
- Run the executable file.

### Step 2 - Download CSV File   
- Clone or [Download](https://www.qt.io/development/download) this repository to your computer. 
- Click `Add Process` Button in GUI to choose a CSV file to add the program.

### Step 3 - Run scheduling Algorithms 

- Click `FCFS` or `SJF` Button to start calculate.   

- The table and Gantt chart will be updated with the result.

### Step 4 - Save result

- Click `Save Output` Button.   

- The detailed result included: State, result of algorithms user choose before will be saved as a CSV file in the output folder.

Step 5 - Exit the program
- Press `Exit` to confirm ending the program.

## 📝 Note 
- You can use `Load Process` to reload a previously saved CSV result file. The result will only display the state and results corresponding to the last algorithm you ran before saving.
- The user can select any process from the output table to delete, or select no processes and click `Remove Process` to delete all processes.

## 📬 Input (CSV file)   

The application uses a CSV file as input to define the list of processes for CPU scheduling simulation.    

### Column Information 
Each input CSV file will have a standard structure consisting of 3 columns:   

| Column | Description |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Process | Unique name or ID of the process |
| Arrival | Time when the process arrives in the ready queue |
| Burst  | The time required for the CPU to execute a process |   

### Example   
Process,Arrival,Burst   
P1,0,5   
P2,2,3   
P3,4,1   

> In this Example, In this example, P1 arrives at the queue at approximately time 0 and it takes 5 units of time for the CPU to complete the process, P2 arrive at 2 after P1 and need 3 units of time to complete, etc..

## 🖥️ Output (On Screen and On CSV File)   
### On Screen Output   
The display result is calculated using an algorithm after inputting the data in 2 tab:   

### 1️⃣ Table Tab   
The results are stored and displayed as a table with 8 columns, including 3 columns for input information and the remaining 5 columns containing calculated information such as:   

| Column | Description |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Start | The time it takes for the program to be loaded into the CPU and begin running |
| Completion | Time the process finishes |
| Turnaround | The total time a process exists in the system |  
| Waiting | The total time a process exists in the system |
| Response | The time from when a process arrives until it is first processed by the CPU |  

// Picture example

### 2️⃣ Gantt Chart Tab   
The application displays a Gantt chart to visualize how CPU resources are allocated to each process over time.   

Each cell in the Gantt chart represents a process being executed by the CPU, and the length of each cell indicates the unit of time each process needs to execute. Labels inside each cell indicate the process ID, while the numbers below show the start and end times of each execution segment.   

// Picture example

Gantt charts allow users to:   

- Observe the execution order of processes.   

- Examine the scheduling behavior of FCFS and SJF (non-priority).   

- Visualize timeout and completion time calculations.

> Additionally, the GUI supports calculating `Average Waiting Time` and `Average Turnaround Time` to help users easily evaluate and gain a clearer understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm.

### Exported Output (CSV File)   
After performing the calculations and printing the results to the screen, the application can export the results to a CSV file in the output folder.   

The output CSV file contains detailed scheduling results for each process, with saved information including the results of the 8 columns in On Screen Output.

//picture example   

> This CSV file can be used to verify the correctness of the scheduling result and to compare with textbook examples.
