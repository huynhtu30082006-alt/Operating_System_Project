# 🖥️ CPU Scheduling Simulator   
(FCFS & Non-Preemptive SJF)
   
## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a desktop-based application developed by our group to simulate and visualize CPU scheduling algorithms, focusing on:   

- First Come First Serve (FCFS)   

- Shortest Job First (SJF – Non-preemptive)   

-> The application allows users to load process data from a CSV file, execute scheduling algorithms, and analyze the results through tables, Gantt charts, and performance metrics.
All results can be exported to CSV for verification with textbook formulas and reporting.   

## 📍 Main Feature    

- [x] Import process data from a CSV file
 
- [x] Add, remove, and manage processes in the application

- [x] Execute FCFS (First Come First Serve) scheduling algorithm

- [x] Execute SJF (Non-preemptive) scheduling algorithm

- [x] Display scheduling results in a process table

- [x] Visualize CPU execution using a Gantt Chart

- [x] Calculate:   

- Start Time

- Completion Time
   
- Turnaround Time
  
- Waiting Time

- Average Waiting Time

- Average Turnaround Time

- Export detailed simulation results to a CSV file

- [x] Support stress testing and performance evaluation
